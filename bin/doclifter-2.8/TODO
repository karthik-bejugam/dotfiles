Bugs:

* Docbook 5 translation is incomplete; inclusions won't work,
  entities are untested.

* I haven't come up with a reliable way to distinguish command synopses 
  from stuff that should be treated as plain text.  This has a couple
  of consequences:

  1. doclifter doesn't recognize command synopses in displays, only in 
     Synopsis sections.

  2. When command synopses have a trailing text section (explanatory
     paragraph) doclifter doesn't always detect that and cope well.

* .Xo/.Xc Berkeley macro needs work. See elf.5.

* Look at lwres_getaddrinfo.3 -- good type case for resuming function parse
  after text.  sox(1) and soxmix(1) show the same problem with command syntax.

* CA.pl.1ssl -- CA.pl is not properly tagged as a command.

See the BUGS file for other, more minor problems mainly due to bad markup.
